# TextFlyer
TextFlyer is a mobile messaging application that allows you to send and receive text messages to and from your phone. Words, numbers, alphanumeric combinations, and emojis can all be included in the text. The TextFlyer application does not require that the phone be active and within range because the messages will be stored for a period of days till the phone is active and within range. The messages are sent to anyone with roaming capability or to other cell phones in the same network. By installing the application from the Microsoft Store to a PC, messages can be sent from the PC to mobile phones.
